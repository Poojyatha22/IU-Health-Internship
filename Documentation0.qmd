## Purpose of this Internship 

One of the main objectives of this Internship was to form a great understanding of medicinal drugs, their hierarchy, their nomenclature etc so that we can easily understand their relationship with diseases and patients which will help us in forming patient cohorts or cohorts for drugs

## More on hierarchy and the objective :

RxNorm is a nomenclature system for drugs. Every drug also has a hierarchy. Drugs can be grouped based on certain criteria. One such criteria is what we call 'Concept'.Under Concept types, we could have further divisions of criteria that help narrow down the hierarchy. A few examples of Concept types / CTY's are Mechanism of Action \[MoA\], Pharmokinetics \[PK\]. Through such an understanding, we can compare to drugs together, understand why two drugs are similar or not similar to each other, what diseases they are used in the treatment of, if one drug can be used in the place of another to treat a disease etc.

## An example of diseases that a drug is used in the treatment of:

In the below picture, we can see that a drug called 'atenolol' is used in the treatment of various diseases that are in the different branches - 'Sick Synus Syndrome' , 'Bradycardia' , 'Myocardial Infarction' , 'Arrhythmia, Sinus' , 'Ventricular Fibrillation' and 'Shock, Cardiogenic'.

```

## Comparing two drugs 

We are going to see the hierarchy of two drugs in the next slide. Both of these drugs come under a concept type called Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical \[ATC\]which has a further sub division called Cardiovascular system adn then a narrower division called Beta Blocking Agents and so on.

## Atenolol

## Bisoprol

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height="15%",  out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bisoprolpath.png", error=FALSE)

```

## More about the my team - Clinical Research Department at IU Health 

Operation of Clinical Trials in Cerner (managing Protocol and Subject information, building Pre-screening to identify trial candidates, building Order sets for research protocols)

Feasibility evaluation, identification of patient cohorts for both retrospective and prospective clinical research, data extraction and analysis as well as development of ML models for research

Design and development of Cohort identification and analysis tool

## The people

I am grateful to have gotten inputs from Dr. Saravanan Kanakasabai, Mr. Gregory Klopper and Mr. Rick Tuason and of course my Supervisor Mr. Harlan A Nelson from the Clinical Research Department.

## How did this project make a difference to the health care system at IU Health?

Instead of associating drugs with diseases, we delve deeper and make searches more complex through including more facets into hierarchy like pharmacological class, concept types, etc. Correlation of drug regimens to diseases and health outcomes.

## Future Work 

Productionize so that it can be run every month -- RxNorm updates the drug data everymonth. A code that automates the job of downloading the latest drug data from RxNorm, parsing the xml files and stage them into Cerner Data Source Mart

Use the ontologies to correlate treatments with health outcomes
