# Indiana University Health Internship
In this internship, we deal with medical drug data from XML and convert this complex xml document into tables with rows and columns with the help of R Studio and different packages like tidy verse, xml2, deeplyr, purr etc. After data manipulation, we combine this data with patient related data at IU Health Server and try to explore data to see if there can be any patient cohorts or drugs cohorts that can be formed to improve health outcomes.
