Hi Everyone!

I am sharing my work at Indiana University Health as a Data Science Intern here! The goal of this internship was to download drug data from the RxNorm website ( https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/overview.html ), analyse this data and try to merge the data related to patients in the IU Health Server so that we can form cohorts of drugs / patients.

RxNorm is a normalised way of naming drugs. Drugs data could exist in different sources with slightly varied names. So RxNorm has a standard was recognizing these drugs with its nomenclature. It also releases drug related data every month with the updated drug list.

You can see the summary of the work I have done with the help of my awesome supervisor Harlan A Nelson! I hope you gain something useful out of this and thanks for checking this out!
