Hey Everybody!

This is Poojyatha Venkatesh! I am passionate about Data Science and playing around with data transformation and manipulation. I recently graduated from Indiana University Purdue University ( 8th of August 2022 ), Indianapolis with a Master's degree in Applied Data Science. I got my Bachelors in Information Technology from College of Engineering - Guindy, Anna University.
